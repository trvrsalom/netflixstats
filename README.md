# Netflix Stats

A simple web app which checks the user's Netflix history to calculate how long they have spent watching a particular Netflix show or movie.

Uses selenium to get the show history, and then uses the [Netflix Roulette API](http://netflixroulette.net/api/) to find the runtime for shows where runtime is available.
